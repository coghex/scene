scene
=====

This scene includes some happy little trees.
the arrow keys look around while w moves forward.
s moves back, a moves left and d moves right.  This
doesnt really work the way I would like it but you
can get where you are trying to go most of the time.
'0' resets the veiw.  escape exits the program.

In order to satisfy the requirements of the assignment
there is a tiny little tree floating at a 45 degree
angle, it looks rediculous.

to compile, go into the directory and enter:
>make clean && make lorenz
this will output lorenz.o, then:
>./lorenz.o

This Assignment took me 5-7 hours to complete
