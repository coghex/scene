scene
=====

This scene includes some happy little trees.
w moves forward s moves back.  a and d make
you rotate left and right.  arrow up and down will
look up and down.  m changes the view mode.
'0' resets the view.  escape exits the program.
In order to pause the moving light press the
spacebar.  once the light has stopped moving,
you can move the light along its circular path
using the q and e keys.  space again will resume
the automatic light spinning.

In order to satisfy the requirements of the assignment
there is a tiny little tree floating at a 45 degree
angle, it looks ridiculous.

The textures need to be in the sam directory at
compilation

to compile, go into the directory and enter:
>make

this will output hw7, then:
>./hw7

This Assignment took me ~10 hours to complete
