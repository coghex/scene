scene
=====

This scene includes some happy little trees.
w moves forward s moves back.  a and d make
you rotate left and right.  arrow up and down will
look up and down.  escape exits the program.
you can move the light along its circular path
using the q and e keys.

all textures are cited in the code and taken from
people who are allowing users to use them for non
commercial purposes.  Many of them were edited
slightly by myself in order to look better or be
small enough for me to reasonably load.

This runs pretty slow on weaker machines, there's
a lot of stuff going on.

to compile, go into the directory and enter:
>make

this will output scene, then:
>./scene

As far as what I had difficulty with, I am still
working on textureing the ground.  Additionally,
the rocks look nice but it would be cool to texture
them too.  This means parsing mtl files.  That sounds
hard so I may or may not do that.  Right now you move
a tree around, I want to make this a person, maybe a
skier.
