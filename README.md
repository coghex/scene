scene
=====

This scene includes some happy little trees.
w moves forward s moves back.  a and d make
you rotate left and right.  arrow up and down will
look up and down.  m changes the view mode.
'0' resets the view.  escape exits the program.
In order to pause the moving light press the
spacebar.  once the light has stopped moving,
you can move the light along its circular path
using the q and e keys.  space again will resume
the automatic light spinning.

all textures are cited in the code and taken from
people who are allowing users to use them for non
commercial purposes.  Many of them were edited
slightly by myself in order to look better.

to compile, go into the directory and enter:
>make

this will output scene, then:
>./scene
