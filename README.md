scene
=====

This scene includes some happy little trees.
w moves forward s moves back.  a and d make
you rotate left and right.  arrow up and down will
look up and down.  m changes the view mode.
'0' resets the view.  escape exits the program.

In order to satisfy the requirements of the assignment
there is a tiny little tree floating at a 45 degree
angle, it looks ridiculous.

to compile, go into the directory and enter:
>make

this will output hw4, then:
>./hw4

This Assignment took me 5-7 hours to complete
